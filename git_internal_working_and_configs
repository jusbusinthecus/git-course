# git ignore
# a file where we can say across the board to skip or ignore this file. It can contain sensitive data.

How does git know me???


git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa" 
git config --global user.email "giovanni1justin@gmail.com"


# configure code editor, I like Atom 

git config core.editor "atom --wait"

# using git ignore

touch .gitignore

# When creating projects there are files known as environment variables that contain sensitive data, such as API keys, AWS keys, openai
keys.

# The gitignore file is where you can put all the files you don't want to be tracked. So for example, if you had a large 
folder of files and wanted to run:

git commit .
or
git add .

# you couldn't because you have those sensitive files included in that working directory. So, put those files in the 
# gitignore file:


HOMEWORK:

Add atom editor to configuration
create more files, at least five
create a git ignore file and place files in the gitignore file. ensure that you no longer see the files when
you run a status on the directory
