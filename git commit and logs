# this will be done from gitbash

git status (while in directory) should always be run first because this lets you know what git is tracking and not tracking.

# currently in gitone folder 
touch testone.txt testtwo.txt

git status - should give an error of untracked files. AKA git is not tracking these files
# the concept is that you write some code, you add that code in the "git tracking zone" , then you commit or save the changes.

# make the files trackable
git add testone.txt

# now check the status
git status
